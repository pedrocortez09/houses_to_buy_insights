# 1. House Rocket and Business Problem
House Rocket is a real state company whose model consist in identifying good properties with a good price and futurely sold for a higher price aiming to maximize profit. For this case, we will be operating on King Country.

Obs: The company and business problem are both fictitious, although the data is real.

This Data Science project is focused on solving two problems:

+ Problem 1: Which properties should House Rocket buy and for which suggested price?
+ Problem 2: Once a property is bought, for which price should it be sold?

# 3. Assumptions
+ Location in real estate is undoubtedly a decisive factor in price evaluation.
+ The address information for these properties was gathered by using the two created modules: address.py and defs.py.

# 4. Solution Plan
## 4.1. How both problems were solved
### Problem 1: Which properties should House Rocket buy and for which suggested price?
To solve this problem, we firstly need to analyse the properties by their location, because in real estate, location is undoubtedly a decisive factor in price evaluation. 
One interesting metric in this case is to calculate the price median by each zipcode, as the median isn't influenced by extreme values (outliers) in the data.

Then we will take the median price for each one of the zipcodes and build a table of recomendation respecting the following rules:

+ Their asked price has to be lower than the median price for that region
+ The property needs to be in good conditions, which means condition >= 3

As for suggested price, we will take into account the density of the region, which means that regions that have more houses to sell, it is viable to offer lower prices. Therefore the rule we will follow is:

+ From 0 to 204 properties in the region => Offer the asked price
+ From 205 to 282 properties in the region => Offer 3% less than the asked price
+ From 283 to 408 properties in the region => Offer 5% less than the asked price
+ From 409 properties upwards => Offer 7% less than the asked price

### Problem 2: After we buy a house, for which price should it be sold?
To suggest a sell price, again the density by region will be considered, since for regions where the number of real estate ads is lower it's possible to sell the property for a higher price, and vice-versa. Hence, a reasonable rule for suggested sell prices is:

+ From 0 to 204 properties in the region => Sell for 15% than the suggested buy price
+ From 205 to 282 properties in the region => Sell for 14% than the suggested buy price
+ From 283 to 408 properties in the region => Sell for 12% than the suggested buy price
+ From 409 properties upwards => Sell for 10% than the suggested buy price

## 4.2. What was delivered as solution
+ Buy Suggestion Table: Contains the suggestion price to buy and sell

## 4.3. Financial Results
+ Profit Descriptive Analyses
+ Average and median profit grouped by zipcode
+ House Rocket Cloud App: App deployed using Streamlit Cloud containing all tables (Buy Suggestion Table, Sell Suggestion Table and Financial Results Tables)
with filters and a Buy Suggestion Map, as well as data insights.

## 4.3. Tools and techniques used
+ Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly and Geopandas.
+ Jupyter Notebook and VSCode.
+ Streamlit and Streamlit Cloud.
+ Git and Github.
+ Measures of Central Tendency and Dispersion.
+ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
